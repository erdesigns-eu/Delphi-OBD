# Delphi-OBD

NOTE: This is a work-in-progress project!

This suite is intended for use of ELM327 compatible adapters. These include the genuine ELM327, Chinese clones, VGate VLinker, OBDLink adapters, etc.
There are components for building a OBD diagnostics application, and while everything already works - i didnt have the time to write some examples yet.

For a guided scaffold that wires the new non-visual components to the Skia-based controls, see [QuickStart.md](QuickStart.md).

Feel free to help out!
