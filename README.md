# Delphi-OBD

NOTE: This is a work-in-progress project!

This suite is intended for use of ELM327 compatible adapters. These include the genuine ELM327, Chinese clones, VGate VLinker, OBDLink adapters, etc.
There are components for building an OBD diagnostics application, and the repository now includes ready-to-run examples.

For a guided scaffold that wires the new non-visual components to the Skia-based controls, see [QuickStart.md](QuickStart.md).

Hands-on samples live under [examples/](examples/). Each folder contains a full Delphi project (DPR + PAS + DFM) for serial, Bluetooth, WiFi, FTDI, simple, and advanced dashboards you can open and run immediately.

Feel free to help out!
